## :heart:This is a REACT-Markdown Editor.

##### This is my seconf markdown editor, I decided to use Vanilla JavaScript for the last one, I challenged myself so I built this markdown-editor with ReactJS, Styled-component, React-ace, React-showdown , React-fontawesome and Lottie for the animation.
### 

Bonus points:

- Live preview
- Selectable themes for input area
- Dark Mood and Light Mood
- Print to PDF
- Responsive design
